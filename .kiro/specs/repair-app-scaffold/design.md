# Design Document - Repair App Scaffold

## Overview

The repair guiding app scaffold is a Flutter-based mobile application that provides users with a structured interface to access repair guides, upload content, and manage their profile. The app follows a tab-based navigation pattern with five main sections, emphasizing user experience through consistent theming, state preservation, and intuitive navigation.

The initial implementation focuses on creating a robust UI skeleton and navigation structure with placeholder content, designed to facilitate easy integration of backend services in future iterations.

## Architecture

### Application Structure
The app follows a standard Flutter architecture with the following key components:

- **Main App**: Entry point with theme configuration and routing setup
- **Tab Navigation**: Bottom navigation bar managing five primary screens
- **Screen Components**: Individual screens for each tab with their own state management
- **Theme System**: Centralized theming with light/dark mode support
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences for persisting user preferences and recent guides

### Navigation Architecture
```
MainApp
├── BottomNavigationBar (IndexedStack for state preservation)
│   ├── HomeScreen
│   ├── SearchScreen
│   ├── MyGuidesScreen
│   ├── ManualsAndChatScreen
│   └── ProfileScreen
```

**Design Decision**: Using IndexedStack ensures that each tab maintains its state (scroll position, form data, navigation stack) when users switch between tabs, providing a seamless user experience.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Bottom Navigation Component
- **Material Design**: Uses Flutter's BottomNavigationBar with Material icons
- **State Management**: IndexedStack preserves individual tab states
- **Theme Integration**: Active tab uses primary brown color, inactive tabs use muted brown
- **Icons**: Material icons for each tab (home, search, bookmark, chat, person)

### 2. Home Screen
- **Welcome Section**: Configurable welcome message component
- **Recent Guides List**: Scrollable list/grid with guide cards
- **Empty State**: Friendly message with optional illustration placeholder
- **Guide Card Component**: Displays title, thumbnail, last opened date, and remove action

### 3. Search Screen
- **Search Bar**: Top-positioned with placeholder for future search functionality
- **Category Navigation**: Hierarchical tree structure for categories/subcategories
- **Search Results**: Placeholder areas for both database and external search results
- **Secondary Search**: "Search Web" button for external source integration

### 4. My Guides Screen
- **Saved Guides List**: Scrollable display of bookmarked guides
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual representation of completion status
- **Guide Management**: Remove/unbookmark functionality
- **Empty State**: Encouraging message to start bookmarking guides

### 5. Manuals & Chat Screen
- **Chat Interface**: Message area with text input field
- **File Upload**: Support for images, PDFs, and camera scanning
- **Manual Cards**: Visual representation of uploaded documents
- **Action Buttons**: Placeholder buttons for OCR, TTS, and RAG functionality

### 6. Profile Screen
- **User Information**: Profile picture, name, email display
- **Authentication State**: Sign in/up placeholder for unauthenticated users
- **Settings Panel**: App preferences and configuration options
- **Security Section**: Account management placeholders

## Data Models

### Guide Model
```dart
class Guide {
  String id;
  String title;
  String? thumbnailUrl;
  DateTime lastOpened;
  int totalSteps;
  int completedSteps;
  bool isBookmarked;
}
```

### Chat Message Model
```dart
class ChatMessage {
  String id;
  String content;
  MessageType type; // user, bot, manual
  DateTime timestamp;
  String? attachmentUrl;
}
```

### User Preferences Model
```dart
class UserPreferences {
  bool isDarkMode;
  String language;
  bool notificationsEnabled;
  List<String> recentGuideIds;
}
```

**Design Decision**: Simple, flat data models that can easily be extended when backend integration is added. Using nullable fields for optional data that may not be available initially.

## Error Handling

### Local Storage Errors
- Graceful fallback to default values when SharedPreferences fails
- Error logging for debugging purposes
- User-friendly messages for critical failures

### Navigation Errors
- Fallback to Home tab if invalid tab index is accessed
- State recovery mechanisms for corrupted navigation state

### File Upload Errors
- Clear error messages for unsupported file types
- Size limit notifications
- Network connectivity checks (placeholder for future implementation)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Data model validation and serialization
- Utility functions for theme switching and local storage
- Navigation logic and state management

### Widget Tests
- Individual screen rendering and interaction
- Bottom navigation behavior and state preservation
- Theme switching functionality
- Empty state displays

### Integration Tests
- Complete user flows through tab navigation
- File upload simulation
- Settings persistence across app restarts
- Dark/light mode transitions

**Design Decision**: Comprehensive testing strategy ensures reliability during rapid development and easy identification of regressions when adding backend functionality.

## Theme System

### Color Schemes
- **Primary Brown Theme**: Consistent brown color palette for branding
- **Light Mode**: High contrast, accessible color combinations
- **Dark Mode**: Eye-friendly dark theme with appropriate contrast ratios
- **Material Design 3**: Leveraging Flutter's Material 3 theming system

### Theme Implementation
```dart
ThemeData lightTheme = ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.light(
    primary: Colors.brown,
    secondary: Colors.brown.shade300,
    // Additional color definitions
  ),
);
```

**Design Decision**: Using Material Design 3's ColorScheme system ensures consistency and accessibility while allowing easy customization of the brown theme throughout the app.

## State Management

### Local State Management
- **StatefulWidget**: For simple, screen-specific state
- **SharedPreferences**: For user preferences and recent guides persistence
- **IndexedStack**: For tab state preservation

### Future Considerations
- Provider/Riverpod integration points identified for backend state management
- API service layer architecture prepared for easy integration
- Caching strategy placeholders for offline functionality

**Design Decision**: Starting with simple state management approaches that can be easily migrated to more sophisticated solutions as the app grows in complexity.

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Lazy loading of tab content
- Image caching strategy for guide thumbnails
- Efficient list rendering with ListView.builder

### Startup Performance
- Minimal initial load with progressive enhancement
- Asynchronous loading of user preferences
- Optimized asset bundling

### Navigation Performance
- IndexedStack prevents unnecessary widget rebuilds
- Efficient state preservation without memory leaks

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic labels for all interactive elements
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Descriptive button labels

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast color schemes
- Scalable text support
- Touch target size compliance (minimum 44px)

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab order optimization
- Focus management during navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

**Design Decision**: Building accessibility into the foundation ensures compliance and better user experience for all users, not as an afterthought.
